What if your friend asks your personal laptop for an emergency. You would have already logged in to all your applications in browser. Then how would you give it to them?

That's where Smart logout chrome extension will be useful. This extension gets a password as input when you lock. It then gets all the cookies stored in browser, encrypts it with the password, stores them and deletes it in browser.

When you want to unlock, you will be asked for the same password. Once submitted, it decryptes the cookies again and paste it back to the browser.

Hence you no need to signout from all websites before you give the machine to others.
